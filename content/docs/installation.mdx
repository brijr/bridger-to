```

2. **Install dependencies**

└── lib/               # Utility functions
```

## Adding Content

Create new `.mdx` files anywhere in the `content/` directory:

```mdx
---
title: "My New Post"
description: "This is my first post"
date: "2025-01-09"
published: true
---

# Hello World

This is my content!
```

The file structure determines the URL:
- `content/example.mdx` → `/example`
- `content/blog/post.mdx` → `/blog/post`
- `content/docs/guide.mdx` → `/docs/guide`

## Configuration

Edit `velite.config.ts` to customize content processing and schema validation.

## Deployment

Deploy to Vercel with one click:

```bash
# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start
```

Your site is now ready for deployment!
