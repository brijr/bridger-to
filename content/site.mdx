This website represents a modern interpretation of classic grid system design principles, drawing inspiration from [Josef Müller-Brockmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_M%C3%BCller-Brockmann)'s seminal work [Grid Systems in Graphic Design](https://designbooks.org/grid-system-in-graphic-design). The site combines timeless design theory with cutting-edge web technologies to create a responsive, accessible, and performant digital experience.

## Design Philosophy

The layout is built on a four-column grid system that adapts seamlessly across different viewport sizes. This approach provides:

- Visual harmony and balance
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Flexible content organization
- Improved readability and hierarchy

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

- **Framework**: Built with Next.js 15 using the App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **Styling**: Combines Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with shadcn/ui for beautiful, accessible components
- **Typography**: Uses Inter, a modern sans-serif typeface designed for screens
- **Content**: Powered by MDX for rich, interactive content authoring

### Grid System

The site implements a custom grid component system that provides:

```typescript
<Grid>
  <Row>
    <Child className="col-span-2"></Child> // Content spans two columns
    <Child></Child> // Single column content
  </Row>
</Grid>
```

This system allows for flexible layouts while maintaining consistent spacing and alignment across all pages.

### Performance Optimizations

- Server Components for reduced client-side JavaScript
- Optimized font loading with `next/font`
- Responsive images and lazy loading
- Edge-optimized deployments via Vercel

## Development Workflow

The site is built using modern development practices:

- Version control with Git
- Automated deployments through Vercel
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Component-driven development
- MDX for content management

## Open Source

This site is built on top of my [MDX Starter](https://github.com/brijr/mdx), which is freely available on GitHub. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own projects.
