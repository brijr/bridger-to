This guide will walk you through deploying your Mastra application to [Railway](https://railway.app/?referralCode=AJtQpy), a modern deployment platform that makes it easy to deploy Node.js applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A Mastra.ai project set up locally
- Node.js 18.x or later installed
- A [Railway account](https://railway.app/new?referralCode=AJtQpy) (sign up with GitHub for easier integration)
- A GitHub account (for GitHub deployment method)
- [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli?referralCode=AJtQpy) installed (for CLI deployment method)

## Understanding Mastra Deployment

Mastra uses Hono as its underlying HTTP server framework. When you build a Mastra application using `mastra build`, it generates a production-ready Hono-based HTTP server in the `.mastra/output` directory. This makes it compatible with any Node.js hosting platform, including Railway.

**Key Points:**

- Development server (`mastra dev`) runs on port 3000
- Production server defaults to port 4111 (configurable)
- Build output is generated in `.mastra/output/`
- The built server is a standard Node.js application

## Step 1: Prepare Your Mastra Application

### 1.1 Configure Your Mastra Instance

First, ensure your Mastra instance is properly configured for production. In your main Mastra configuration file (typically `src/mastra/index.ts`):

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // Configure server settings
  server: {
    port: process.env.PORT || 4111, // Railway sets PORT automatically
    timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
  },
  // Add your agents, workflows, and other configurations
  agents: {
    // your agents here
  },
  // Add any logging configuration
  logger: {
    level: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "info" : "debug",
  },
});
```

### 1.2 Update package.json

Ensure your `package.json` includes the necessary scripts and Node.js version:

```json
{
  "name": "your-mastra-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "mastra dev",
    "build": "mastra build",
    "start": "node .mastra/output/index.js",
    "postinstall": "mastra build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@mastra/core": "latest"
    // your other dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "mastra": "latest",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^18.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Important Notes**:

- The `postinstall` script ensures Mastra builds automatically after Railway installs dependencies
- The `start` script runs the built Hono server from `.mastra/output/index.js`
- `mastra` CLI is a devDependency, while `@mastra/core` is a regular dependency

### 1.3 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.example` file to document required environment variables:

```bash
# LLM API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key

# Database (if using)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# Other configuration
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Note**: Never commit your actual `.env` file to Git. Add it to `.gitignore`.

### 1.4 Update .gitignore

Ensure your `.gitignore` includes:

```
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local

# Mastra build output
.mastra/

# Node modules
node_modules/

# TypeScript build info
*.tsbuildinfo
```

## Step 2: Build Your Application Locally

Before deploying, test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# This creates the production server in .mastra/output/

# Test the production server
NODE_ENV=production npm start
# Or run directly:
NODE_ENV=production node .mastra/output/index.js
```

This should start your Mastra server on the configured port (default 4111).

## Step 3: Deploy to Railway

You have three options for deploying to Railway:

### Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new Railway project**:

   - Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard?referralCode=AJtQpy)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Authorize Railway to access your GitHub (if not already done)
   - Select your Mastra repository
   - Choose the branch to deploy (usually `main`)

3. **Configure environment variables**:

   - In the Railway project dashboard, click on your service
   - Go to the "Variables" tab
   - Click "Add Variable" and add all your environment variables:
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
     - `DATABASE_URL` (if applicable)
     - Any other required variables

4. **Deploy**:
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js app
   - It will run `npm install` followed by `npm run build` (via postinstall)
   - Then it will run `npm start` to start your server

### Option B: Deploy with Railway CLI

1. **Install Railway CLI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**:

   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize a new project**:

   ```bash
   railway init
   ```

   Follow the prompts to name your project.

4. **Set environment variables**:

   ```bash
   railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
   railway variables set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
   # Set other variables as needed
   ```

5. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

### Option C: Deploy with Dockerfile

If you prefer more control, create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js LTS
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies (including devDependencies for build)
RUN npm ci

# Copy application files
COPY . .

# Build Mastra application
RUN npm run build

# Remove devDependencies after build
RUN npm prune --production

# Expose port (Railway sets PORT automatically)
EXPOSE 4111

# Start the application
CMD ["node", ".mastra/output/index.js"]
```

Then deploy using either GitHub or CLI method above.

## Step 4: Generate a Public Domain

Once deployment is complete:

1. In your Railway project dashboard, click on your service
2. Go to the "Settings" tab
3. Under "Networking", click "Generate Domain"
4. Railway will provide a URL like `your-app.up.railway.app`

## Step 5: Configure Client Applications

Update your client applications to use the Railway URL:

```typescript
import { MastraClient } from "@mastra/client-js";

const client = new MastraClient({
  baseUrl:
    process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
      ? "https://your-app.up.railway.app"
      : "http://localhost:4111",
});
```

## Deployment Best Practices

### 1. Use Environment-Specific Configuration

```typescript
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    port: process.env.PORT || 4111,
    cors: {
      origin: isDevelopment
        ? ["http://localhost:3000"]
        : ["https://your-frontend.com"],
    },
  },
});
```

### 2. Set Up Health Checks

Add a health check endpoint to monitor your application:

```typescript
mastra.route({
  method: "GET",
  path: "/health",
  handler: async (req) => {
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({
        status: "healthy",
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      }),
      {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      }
    );
  },
});
```

### 3. Configure Logging

Use appropriate logging levels for production:

```typescript
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "mastra-app",
    level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || "info",
  }),
});
```

### 4. Database Considerations

If using a database with Mastra:

- Railway provides PostgreSQL databases that work well with Mastra
- The `DATABASE_URL` will be automatically set when you provision a database
- **Important**: Railway uses an ephemeral file system, so avoid file-based storage
- For SQLite/LibSQL, use remote URLs instead of file-based storage (e.g., Turso)
- Never use `file:./database.db` or similar file paths on Railway

## Monitoring and Debugging

### View Logs

In [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard?referralCode=AJtQpy):

1. Click on your service
2. Go to the "Logs" tab to see real-time logs
3. Use filters to search for specific log entries

### Using Railway CLI for logs:

```bash
railway logs
```

### Check Deployment Status

Monitor your deployment:

- Build logs show compilation and dependency installation
- Deploy logs show the running application
- Look for "Server running on port XXXX" or similar message to confirm successful start
- The built Hono server will log when it's ready to accept connections

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Build fails with "mastra: command not found"

**Solution**: Ensure `mastra` is in your devDependencies:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "mastra": "latest"
  }
}
```

### Issue: Server starts but can't be accessed

**Solution**: Ensure your server binds to `0.0.0.0` and uses Railway's PORT:

```typescript
server: {
  port: process.env.PORT || 4111,
  hostname: '0.0.0.0'
}
```

### Issue: Environment variables not working

**Solution**:

- Check Railway's Variables tab for typos
- Restart the service after adding variables
- Use `railway variables` CLI command to verify

### Issue: Memory or timeout errors

**Solution**: Railway's free tier has limits. For production:

- Upgrade to a paid plan for more resources
- Optimize your Mastra workflows
- Implement proper error handling and timeouts

## Next Steps

1. **Set up CI/CD**: Railway automatically deploys on push to your connected branch
2. **Configure custom domain**: Add your own domain in Railway's settings
3. **Set up monitoring**: Use Railway's metrics or integrate external monitoring
4. **Scale your application**: Railway supports both vertical and horizontal scaling
