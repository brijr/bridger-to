If you're building websites and not using JSON-LD, you're leaving easy wins on the table.

Here's the deal: Google is smart, but it's not that smart. It can read your content, sure. But JSON-LD lets you tell Google exactly what your page is about in a language it understands perfectly.

## What is JSON-LD?

It's structured data. A little block of code (usually in your `<head>`) that describes your content in a standardized way. Think of it as metadata on steroids.

```json
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "JSON-LD: The SEO Cheat Code",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Bridger Tower"
  }
}
</script>
```

That's it. You're telling Google: "This is an article. Here's the title. Here's who wrote it."

## Why Should You Care?

Rich results. Those fancy search listings with stars, images, FAQs, prices—that's all powered by structured data. More visibility. Higher click-through rates.

## The Types That Matter Most

- **Article** or **BlogPosting** for content
- **Product** for e-commerce
- **FAQPage** for... FAQ pages
- **Organization** for your business
- **Person** for personal brands

## The Practical Move

If you're in Next.js, just drop a `<script>` tag in your layout or use `next/head`. There are libraries that help, but honestly? Copy-paste from schema.org and customize. Don't overthink it.

Start with one page. Test it in Google's Rich Results Test. Ship it.
