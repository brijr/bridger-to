## Introduction

MDX is a powerful tool that lets you use JSX in your markdown content. This means you can import and use React components directly in your markdown files!

## Why MDX?

1. **Component Integration** - Use React components anywhere in your content
2. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support
3. **Flexibility** - Mix markdown with custom components
4. **Performance** - Static generation with Next.js

## Basic Syntax

Here's a simple example:

```mdx
import { MyComponent } from "./components";

# Hello World

This is regular markdown content.

<MyComponent />

And we're back to markdown!
```

## Code Highlighting

The template includes beautiful code highlighting with copy-to-clipboard functionality:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, MDX!";
console.log(greeting);
```

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Next Steps

- Explore the `content/` directory to see more examples
- Add your own MDX files in any folder structure
- Customize the components in `components/posts/`

Happy writing!
