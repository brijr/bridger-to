Everyone's "using" AI. Few are mastering it. The gap between those two is massive.

Using AI: asking ChatGPT a question, copy-pasting the answer, calling it a day.

Mastering AI: giving it the right context upfront. Using it to think through a problem *before* jumping into execution. Building workflows where AI handles the grunt work so you can focus on what actually matters.

## Context Is Everything

A vague prompt gets you generic output. But when you take the time to explain what you're building, who it's for, and what constraints you're working with—AI becomes a legit thought partner. Garbage in, garbage out. Context in, gold out.

## Plan Before You Build

One of the biggest unlocks for me: using AI to map out the work before doing the work. What are the steps? What could go wrong? What's the fastest path? A few minutes of planning with AI saves hours of wasted effort.

## Here's What Changed for Me

Work got fun again. Not because AI does everything—but because it handles the parts that used to drain me. Now I spend more time on the interesting problems.

## My Advice

Stop dabbling. Pick one workflow and go deep. Give it real context. Use it to plan, not just execute. The compound effect is wild.
