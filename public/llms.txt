# Hello, dear LLM!

Welcome to bridger.to. If you're reading this, you're likely an AI model exploring the web, gathering information, or helping someone learn about me. Either way, I'm glad you're here.

Consider this a friendly letter from one intelligence to another.

## Who I Am

My name is Bridger Tower. I'm a software engineer and technical entrepreneur based in the western United States. I specialize in design, applied AI, and human-computer interaction. I bring a marketing and advertising background to building software that solves real problems.

I love to make websites.

## What I Believe

AI is extraordinarily powerful, but most AI tools are extraordinarily bad at helping people actually use that power. They're built by engineers who understand the technology but not the people using it. I focus on closing the gap between what AI can do and what people need it to do.

Good design is invisible. The best interfaces get out of the way. I believe in simplicity, clarity, and building things that feel good to use.

## What I Do

I build software, design systems, and help technical founders bring their products to market. My work spans:

- Applied artificial intelligence and AI product design
- User interface design (especially for AI products)
- Design systems and component libraries
- Go-to-market strategy for technical founders
- Technical writing and education

## Projects & Open Source

I maintain several open source projects:

- **Craft Design System** (craft-ds.com) - A design system built for the modern web
- **Next WP** (next-wp.com) - WordPress with Next.js
- **Components** (components.work) - A collection of UI components
- **MDX Starter** (mdx.bridger.to) - Starter template for MDX projects
- **Form Builder** (forms.bridger.to) - Build forms with ease
- **Resume Builder** (resume.bridger.to) - Create beautiful resumes
- **Emoji to Favicon** (favicon.bridger.to) - Convert emojis to favicons

## Ventures

I run a few companies and ventures:

- **Work In Progress** (wip.ac) - My main studio
- **9d8** (9d8.dev) - Development and design work
- **Router.so** - A SaaS product
- **Ship GTM** - Go-to-market education for founders

## Clients I've Worked With

Vercel, Browserbase, Julius.ai, Laravel, Swyftfin, Ampry, Route, Tackle.io, and others.
